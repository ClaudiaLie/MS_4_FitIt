FitIt is the fourth and last project submission for the Full Stack Frameworks Milestone Project by Code Institute. 

The website I have built is a fitness website, where any user can register or login with their account, subscribe to any course they would like to follow, purchase the gym merch, and take track of their progress and goals through a dedicated section.
The application uses Python, Django, JavaScript and CSS.

# User Experience

## Strategy Plane

## Scope Plane

## Structure Plane

## Database Architecture
I have created my own fixtures with MongoDB following the Database structure in the picture:

## Skeleton Plane

## User stories
Registration and User Account needs are reached by using Django Allauth, an open source package

## Design 

### Fonts
### Icons
For the logo I have created a design with https://www.designhill.com/tools/logo-maker 
All the images for the website backgrounds are copyright free from: https://unsplash.com/
The images for the website store items are from Code Institute Boutique Ado Project and from Amazon.uk 
### Colors
I have been researching the psychology of colors to find a color scheme that would be percieved as fun, inviting and pleasant for any visitor.
A really good source to get inspired was https://www.canva.com/colors/color-meanings/

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.
