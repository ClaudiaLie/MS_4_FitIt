FitIt is the fourth and last project submission for the Full Stack Frameworks Milestone Project by Code Institute. 

The project consists in a gym website, where any user can register or login with their account, subscribe to any subscription plan they prefer, purchase the gym merch, and take track of their purchases.
The application uses Python, Django, JavaScript and CSS as main technologies.
